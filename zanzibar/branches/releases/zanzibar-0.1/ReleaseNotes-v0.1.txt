Release Notes for Zanzibar v0.1:
================================
Zanzibar is a speech application server.  It integrates with VOIP telephony
servers (such as a PBX) to receive call.  In addition it integrates with MRCPv2 
Servers  to make use of speech resources (such as recognizers and speech sythesizers).
Speech applications can be defined in voicexml or they can be plain java programs that
use MRCPv2 calls directly.

This is the first release for the Zanzibar project.  This release provides
support for basic speech synthesis and speech recognition functionality
using Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) for the control
channel between the speech client and the speech resource and Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) for streaming audio to and from the media
sink/source.
